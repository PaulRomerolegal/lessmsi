========

This is a utility with a graphical user interface and a command line interface that can be used to view and extract the contents of an MSI file. 

Usage
========
To extract from the command line:

     lessmsi x <msiFileName> [<outouptDir>]

For more command line usage see [CommandLine](https://github.com/activescott/lessmsi/wiki/Command-Line).

Installation
========
Install [via Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/lessmsi) (or [download a zip](https://github.com/activescott/lessmsi/releases/latest)).

Features
==========
Windows Explorer Integration
-----
Lessmsi also integrates with Windows Explorer so that you can right-click on a Windows Installer file (.msi file) and select "Extract Files" to extract it into a folder right there:

Just select _Preferences_ from the _Edit_ menu to enable (or disable) the explorer integration:

GUI
-----
In addition to allowing you to extract files from the command line and from inside Windows Explorer, lessmsi has a graphical user interface that allows you to view detailed information about any MSI file.

MSI Table Viewer
-----
Windows Installer (.msi files) are based on an internal database of tables. Lessmsi features a viewer for those tables. Useful for people who work a lot with installers.

lessmsi on OS X using WINE
-----

All of the following approaches give errors on the command line, but seem to work regardless.

#### lessmsi command line using wine
use lessmsi on the command line using wine: (this example uses the wine.app that comes with winebottler)

    /Applications/Wine.app/Contents/Resources/bin/wine /Users/username/Downloads/lessmsi-v1.2.0/lessmsi.exe v /Users/username/Downloads/msi2xml-2.2.1.957.msi 

#### lessmsi GUI using wine

You can download a zip compressed .app created with winebottler here:  https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/640753/lessmsi.zip

#### You can make it yourself using the following screenshot & winebottler:
